This Python script implements a simple OTP (One-Time Password) authentication system using email. Here’s a brief description of the project:

### Project Overview

Objective:
The script generates a 6-digit OTP, sends it to the user’s email address, and then validates the OTP entered by the user to grant or deny access.

Components:
1. OTP Generation: 
   - A function (`generate_otp`) creates a random 6-digit number that serves as the OTP.

2. Email Sending:
   - The `send_otp` function uses Gmail’s SMTP server to send the OTP to the provided email address. It handles errors related to email sending and authentication.

3. OTP Validation:
   - The `validate_otp` function prompts the user to enter the OTP they received and checks if it matches the generated OTP.

4. User Input and Flow:
   - The `main` function manages user input for the email address, initiates OTP generation and sending, and then validates the OTP to determine if access should be granted or denied.

Key Features:
- Email Validation: Ensures the email address format is valid before sending the OTP.
- Error Handling: Catches errors related to email sending and authentication issues.
- User Interaction: Prompts the user for their email address and OTP input, providing feedback based on the validity of the OTP.

Use Case:
This script can be used for implementing a basic authentication system where users need to verify their identity through a one-time password sent to their email. It’s useful for applications requiring a simple verification step to enhance security.
